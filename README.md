## ⚠️ Important Notice

> 🔧 **Backend Integration Pending**  
>
> The current version of this project **does not yet include full backend integration with Firebase**.  
> This is due to time constraints and limited access to testing devices.  
>
> ✅ However, the Firebase configuration is already set up and ready to be integrated.
